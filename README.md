# Firebase Realtime Database Performance Issue

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue encountered when using Firebase's Realtime Database with large datasets or high write frequencies. The issue stems from inefficient data structuring and a lack of batching operations, leading to significant performance degradation and potential timeout errors.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains code that illustrates the problem.  Data is written to the database one item at a time, causing excessive overhead with large datasets. This approach can lead to slow loading times, increased latency, and potential timeouts.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more efficient solution using batch writes and optimized data structures.  Batch writing significantly reduces the number of round trips to the database, improving performance and stability.  The solution also incorporates a more efficient data structure that facilitates faster retrieval and updates.

## How to reproduce

1.  Set up a Firebase project.
2.  Replace placeholders with your Firebase configuration.
3.  Run `bug.js` to observe the performance issue.
4.  Run `bugSolution.js` to see the improvement with the optimized approach.
