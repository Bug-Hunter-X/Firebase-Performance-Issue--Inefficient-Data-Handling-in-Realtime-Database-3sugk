The following code snippet demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's Realtime Database when dealing with large datasets or high write frequency.  The problem arises from inefficient data structuring and a lack of batching operations, leading to performance degradation and potential timeout issues.

```javascript
// Inefficient data structure and frequent individual writes
const database = firebase.database();

const writeData = (data) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    database.ref(`items/${data[i].id}`).set(data[i]);
  }
};
```
